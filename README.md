### Tommy Unger's github page

I enjoy designing and making things from analytics experiences to backend systems solutions. I will always get my hands dirty with data from kilobytes to petabytes in size. Valuable insights and solutions can be found everywhere and I like to help others see things in data that they didn't think was even possible.
