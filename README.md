### Tommy Unger's github page

I enjoy designing and making things from analytics experiences to backend data warehouse systems and solutions. Every byte matters, from kilobytes to petabytes. I think valuable insights can be found everywhere and I like to help others see things in data that they didn't think was even possible. My most recent little endeavor is creating visualizations of Washington Winter Weather in the Cascades for optimal decision making for snowboarding and skiing. https://datatommy.com/skimail/
